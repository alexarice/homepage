* About Me

I am working within the theory group at the School of Computer Science
at the University of Birmingham. My main interest at the moment is in
category theory, especially higher category theory though I am also
interested in learning Homotopy Type Theory. I am currently working on
the graphical proof assistant [[https://homotopy.io][homotopy-io]], which is based on the
theory of [[https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/associative+n-category][associative n-categories]].

Before starting my PhD I completed a 4-year integrated masters program
in Mathematics and Computer Science at the University of Oxford.
During this time I took courses including Category Theory (including
theory of monoidal categories), Algebraic Topology, Homological
Algebra, Logic, ZFC Set Theory, and Representation Theory.

I also enjoy playing with functional programming languages such as
Haskell or Agda and am a user of Emacs and the Nixos Linux
distribution.

* Teaching
- I am currently TAing "Advanced Functional Programming" (Autumn 2019)
